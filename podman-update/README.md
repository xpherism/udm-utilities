```
## Requirements

1. You have successfully set up the on boot script described [here](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/tree/main/on-boot-script)
1. [05-install-cni-plugins.sh](../cni-plugins/05-install-cni-plugins.sh) installed

## Customization

* You can disable exposing the docker daemon by commenting out the podman service in  [01-podman-update.sh](bin.OLD.DONT USE/01-podman-update.sh)
  
## Podman Build Process
* This is a custom-built binary by me.  It was cross compiled on Ubuntu-20.04 in WSL2. 
* The Makefile needs tweaks. I have supplied the [Makefile.patch](build/podman.Makefile.patch). Apply it to a fresh [podman](https://github.com/containers/podman/) checkout
* You will need [libseccomp-dev:arm64](build/libseccomp-dev_2.2.3-3ubuntu3_arm64.deb) package installed
* You will need [go](https://golang.org/doc/install#download) > 1.12.1 installed
* Setup Cross-Compiler
```sh
sudo apt-get install libc6-arm64-cross libc6-dev-arm64-cross binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu libncurses5-dev build-essential bison flex libssl-dev bc gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```
* Compile
```sh
make CC="aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc" local-cross
```
## Step

1. Goto the Actions tab and get the latest Podman build and unzip it in your the root of your filesystem, something better is coming but for now that will have to do.
   You can write a script to automate it, i suggest lots of testing though!
1. Verify Podman version
```sh
$ podman version
Version:      3.2.0-dev
API Version:  3.2.0-dev
Go Version:   go1.16.4
Git Commit:   78df4f6fb2e2a404ace69219a50652f4335b7ce1-dirty
Built:        Tue May 25 04:52:19 2021
OS/Arch:      linux/arm64
```

## Docker Compose
There is no docker-compose binary to run on the UDM yet, so please use docker-compose from a remote system and specify to run on your UDM.
    
```docker-compose -H 10.0.0.1:2375 up```

You can also use any regular docker binary and do remote management as well
```
$ docker -H 10.0.0.1:2375 ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                  COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS       PORTS     NAMES
608a24fd121e   localhost/unifi-os:latest              "/sbin/init"             8 weeks ago     Up 8 days              unifi-os
```
