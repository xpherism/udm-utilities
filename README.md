[![UDM-SE Podman](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/actions/workflows/podman-udmse.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/actions/workflows/podman-udmse.yml)

A collection of things to enhance the capabilities of your Unifi Dream Machine, Dream Machine Pro or UXG-Pro.

## Custom Kernel

If you want to do a custom kernel with wireguard support, multicast, multipath routing that is now a possiblity.
Please see the repo and please use at your own risk. This a much larger change than anything in this repo.

## Custom Podman Builds for UDM-SE

<https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/actions>

Extract the zip to the root of your device!
Look at the assets on the Podman workflow.

## General Tools

### on-boot-script

Do this first. Enables `init.d` style scripts to run on every boot of your UDM.
Includes examples to run `wpa-supplicant/eap-proxy` and/or `ntop-ng` on startup.
Follow this [readme](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/blob/main/on-boot-script/README.md).

**It enables complete customization of your UDM/P and fills the gap that config.gateway.json left behind.**

### podman-update

Updates Podman, conmon, and runc to a recent version.
This allows docker-compose usage as well.

### container-common

Apply this after on-boot-script.
Updates container defaults to maintain **stable disk usage footprint** of custom containers.
**Prevents logs filling up UDM storage full**.

### python

If you need python3 on your UDM, generally not recommended, can always use it in unifi-os container.

### UDM Persistent SSH Keys Script

<https://github.com/fire1ce/UDM-Persistent-SSH-Keys>

Script to presist ssh keys after reboot or firmware update

## VPN Servers / Clients
| Name 	| URL 	| Description 	|
|------	|-----	|-------------	|

| split-vpn | <https://github.com/peacey/split-vpn> |A split tunnel VPN script for the UDM with policy based routing. This helper script can be used on your UDM to route select VLANs, clients, or even domains through a VPN connection. It supports OpenVPN, WireGuard, and OpenConnect (Cisco AnyConnect) clients running directly on your UDM, and external VPN clients running on other servers on your network. |


## DNS Providers

Install a DNS server that functions as a network-wide ad and tracker blocker, and which can also securely proxy encrypted DNS requests to an upstream DNS provider.
Begin by following the instructions to setup [on-boot-script](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/tree/main/on-boot-script) and [dns-common](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/tree/main/dns-common/on_boot.d).
Then, follow the guides below to setup either Pi-Hole, NextDNS, or AdGuard Home.

### dns-common

Base configuration for DNS server containers, both IPv4 and IPv6.
Utilizes MacVLAN CNI plugins to completely isolate the network stack.

### nextdns

Run NextDNS on your UDM with podman.

### run-pihole
